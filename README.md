# Huffman-Coding-project

This project is about implementation of Huffman coding algorithm in C++.

It is used for data compression and gives shorter binary codes to characters that are appear more often. so, characters that appear less frequently get longer binary codes.

The program builds a Huffman codes in preorder traversal and algorithm helps reduce the total size of data without losing information.

This project shows how greedy algorithms work in real-world data compression.
